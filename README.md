# ichor

Ichor (ἰχώρ), in Greek mythology, is the lifeforce of the gods. It is what grants them immortality and divinity, and is their equivalent of blood. 
References to this ethereal substance can be found in Homeric texts, such as the Iliad, where the ichor of Aphrodite is spilt by the hero Diomedes, during his hour of arestia, divine honor.
It is also scattered in the writings of Roman poets, such as Virgil, who states that the ichor of Ouranous gave birth to the next line of divinity, such as the Furies, the Nymphs, and Venus.

Just as the lifeblood of computers, the machines that are responsible for modern societal success and survival, is code, I aspire to create code that is to contemportary code as ichor is to blood. 
I am ambitious, but also dedicated (and bored). So this repository will be the product of the next upcoming years, and hopefully, the crowning achievment of my software and exploit development career up to this point. And maybe I will create the much-needed purity of ichor for the toxic modern bloodstream.
